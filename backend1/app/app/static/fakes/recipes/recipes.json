{"title":"Rice Roll","rid":4,"prl":"fakes/recipes/Rice_Roll.jpg","desc":"Recipe from my hometown.","step":"Mix all the ingredients for the batter. Stir until it is well-mixed and no lumps. Prepare a steamer (big enough to harbour an 8 inches tray). Prepare 2 of the 8 inches trays. Brush with some oil or use cooking spray. Laddle about 1/4 cup (25 ml) of the flour mixture onto the tray and swirl around to cover the entire tray. It helps to actually put the tray in the steamer first and then ladle the batter and swirl, it covers the surface much better. Cover with lid for 2-3 minutes, my mom said she 4-5 minutes worked for her. The flour mixture will turn white and slightly transclucent. Make sure the heat is high enough. If it’s not hot enough, the flour mixture will not congeal and it will taste starchy. Repeat this process with another tray and while another one is steaming, you can roll this one that is ready. Use a rubber spatula to scrape off any batter that gets stuck to the pan and then oil the pan again and continue with the process. Make sure you stir the flour mixture EVERY TIME before you laddle it to the tray. The flour mixture tends to settle at the bottom after a while. Garnish with sesame seeds fried shallot crisp and douse with the sauce","region":"China","ing":"sdsd","kind":"meal","works":[],"ts":{"$date":"2017-12-05T16:53:34.173Z"},"rate":0.0,"ppl":1.0,"ming":"rice","img":""},

{"title":"Niku Udon","prl":"fakes/recipes/Niku_Udon.jpg","rid":6,"desc":"Great work from Nami Chen.","step":"Gather all the ingredients. In a small saucepan, add 2 cups (480 ml) dashi and 1 tsp. sugar. Add 1 Tbsp. mirin and 1 Tbsp. soy sauce and bring it to a boil. Taste the soup and adjust the taste with Kosher salt as it will enhance the flavor without adding additional sugar or soy sauce. Cover and keep it on low heat. Cut the Tokyo negi (or use sub) and Narutomaki (fish cake) diagonally. Cut the Mitsuba (optional) into small pieces and thinly slice one onion/scallion (used for topping). Cut the thinly sliced meat into bite size pieces. Bring a big pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, cook the frozen udon for 1 minute. Loosen up the noodles once they started to separate. Once the udon is done cooking, use fine sieve to drain water and transfer to serving bowls. While cooking udon, you can start heating the large frying pan. Once it’s heated, add 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil and cook the Tokyo negi until tender. Add the meat and brown all sides. Don’t move the meat around until it’s nicely seared. Once the meat is nicely browned, add ½ to 1 Tbsp. sugar and 1 Tbsp. soy sauce. When the sauce has caramelized and slightly thicken, turn off the heat. By this time, the noodle should be in the serving bowls. Pour the hot soup over the udon noodles in the bowls. Then serve the meat on top of the udon noodles. Place the narutomaki (fish cake) and garnish with scallion and mitsuba. If you like it spicy, sprinkle Shichimi Togarashi (Japanese 7 spice).
